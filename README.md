# Expo Movies

### This app allows you to see the movies now playing, upcoming and top rated. You can also search movies and view the trailers.

### Built with Expo

---

This application is to display my skillset building a React Native project using Expo. It uses the new Expo file base routing. The application uses the moviedb api to get data to display.
Thanks for visiting and I hope you like the application.
